The highlights were N2 and N3. \r\n\r\nThe weather forecasted was awful and was lowkey surprised we even got a show to begin with-my friend and I debated whether they'd cancel Sunday. So the fact we got a show at all was a win. Another thing was, lots of folks got the day set they all complained about wanting-got it-then complained about it!!! Literally wtf lol. \r\n\r\nAll I gotta say is looking at the setlist and having seen it in good company, it was a nice lil cherry on top of a fantastic festival.",
