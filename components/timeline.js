So Trey came up with the idea to write new songs. He got the band together and everyone brainstormed around their past memories and came up with the lyrics. In order to free themselves from their typical 3.0 style, they created a fake Scandinavian band called \"Kasvot Växt\", and made up a story of how they were all scientists who all met and ended up making an album in the late 70s/early 80s, which went into total obscurity. The band acted as if they got ahold of a tape of the album \"í rokk\" years ago, and were finally going to cover it for the costume set on Halloween (whenever they play a Halloween show, they cover a full album by another band in the 2nd set out of 3). The result was 10 new songs that approached the creativity and mystique of The Story of the Ghost (played exactly 20 years and 4 days after the release of that album), in which it took the fans at least few days to fully realize they were brand new Phish originals. I'd say it's some of the best and most interesting stuff they've written in 3.0, even though they spent less than 2 months on it.\n\n\"We Are Come To Outlive Our Brains\" is my personal favorite. Similar sounding to Taste, Theme From the Bottom, and Round Room. Includes Trey's and a lot of fans' favorite lyric \"I'm the glue in your magnet!\"\n\n\"The Final Hurrah\" changes moods quite a bit, and sort of acts as the title track. The ending is also great.\n\n\"Death Don't Hurt Very Long\" is pure slow minor key funk.\n\n\"Cool Amber and Mercury\" is one of the more Phishy songs, and the most underrated.",
